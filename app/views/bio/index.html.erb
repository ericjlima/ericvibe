                    <p>Oh and here's my quick overview about myself. My name is Eric, I'm a software developer in Boston. I have a CS degree and my primary stack is rails, react, scss, etc.</p>
                    <!-- <p>Hi, I'm Eric. I'm a software developer by profession and currently living in the Boston area.  In the past, I've specalized in Front and Back end development in Javascript, PHP, and Ruby. Currently, I'm interested in learning frameworks like Node.JS and Rails. I made this website in order to allow people an easy way to get to know me and what I do.</p>
                    <p>My decision to get into programming happened from an early age. Like many children, I enjoyed playing video games growing up. My gaming obsession evolved into a programming obession as I became curious about how games were made. My first real step into programming was creating a BOT script to play an MMORPG game for me when I was 12 years old. In high school, I took the only programming class my school offered, Java. I did rather poorly in that class but my inability to understand Java only grew my obsession to learn programming. In 2008, I started college and decided to take Compuer Science. It was a fairly easy decision for me since I've always enjoyed computers and I still needed to fill that programming curiosity. I studied C and C++ during my college years and managed to leave with the sense that I actually was a programmer. </p>
<p>After getting my degree, I began my job search. I needed some experience so I began to go to meetup groups web development. The meetup groups led to many work opportunities and eventually got me on my career as a web developer.</p>
<p>In recent years, I've worked with many clients including General Electric, M.I.T., Ritz Carlton and many more. Many of the projects were featuring some type of product or service. The sites were by all means considered high-end websites. These sites work on many screen-sizes and look incredible. Be sure to check out my portfolio to see a few.</p> -->
                    <p>Some other things about me:

                        <li><b>I'm a bicyclist.</b> I enjoy biking as a means of transportation since I grew up in Boston most my life.</li>
                        <li><b>I'm a wannabee travel junkie</b> I've traveled throughout the United States. Recently, I've been traveling outside the U.S. and want to do more. I like to go places I've never been. Still many more to visit! </li>
                         <li><b>Born gamer</b> I was born in the 1980s so that means I grew up with a Nintendo by my side. Usually after a days work of doing web development, I induldge in some kind of video game related things at night. I think this hobby lead me to the path of becoming a developer; however, I do struggle occasionally with allocating my time not playing games.</b></li>
                        <li><b>I'm a fitness rat.</b> Over the past year I've acutually been going to the gym. I skip many days but I try to do what I can whenever and feel guilty about all the skipping I've done. I'm also not particularly fond of beer.</li>
